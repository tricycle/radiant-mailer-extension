The Mailer extension enables form mail on a page. You can define email
templates using pages parts (email, and/or email_html). You configure
the recipients and other Mailer settings in a config part. Following
is an example of a properly formed config part that defines a 'contact'
mailer:

mailers:
  contact:
    subject: From the website of Whatever
    from: noreply@mydomain.com
    redirect_to: /contact/thank-you
    recipients:
      - one@one.com
      - two@two.com

The following tags are available to help you build the form:
    <r:mailer:form name=""> ... </r:mailer:form> 
    <r:mailer:text name="" /> 
    <r:mailer:password name="" />
    <r:mailer:file name="" />
    <r:mailer:checkbox name="" />
    <r:mailer:radio name="" />
    <r:mailer:radiogroup name=""> ... </r:mailer:radiogroup>
    <r:mailer:select name=""> ... </r:mailer:select>
    <r:mailer:textarea name=""> ... </r:mailer:textarea>
    <r:mailer:option name="" />
    <r:mailer:submit />
    <r:mailer:reset />
    <r:mailer:submit_placeholder />

... and the following to help you build the email or email_html templates.
    <r:mailer:get name="" />

Simple example of a form:

<r:mailer:form name="contact">
 <r:mailer:hidden name="subject" value="Email from my Radiant site!" /> <br/>
  Name:<br/>
 <r:mailer:text name="name" /> <br/>
  Message:<br/>
 <r:mailer:textarea name="message" /> <br/>
 <r:mailer:submit value="Send" />
</r:mailer:form>

Forms with file attachments:

In many cases it is desirable to limit the maximum size of a file that may be uploaded.
This is set as the max_filesize attribute for mailers in the config page part. Any file
included in the form will have the limit imposed. Following is a simple example config
part that includes a file size limit of 100,000 bytes:
    mailers:
      contact:
        subject: From the website of Whatever
        from: noreply@mydomain.com
        redirect_to: /contact/thank-you
        max_filesize: 100000
        recipients:
          - one@one.com
          - two@two.com

The following is a simple form that might be used to submit a file for the above
configuration:
    <r:mailer:form name="contact">
        Type your message: <r:mailer:text name="themessage" /> <br/>
        Select a file: <r:mailer:file name="thefile" /> <br/>
        <r:mailer:submit value="submit"/>
    </r:mailer:form>

If a user does not select a file the other form contents will still be e-mailed. 
The <r:mailer:get name="foo" /> (with <r:mailer:file name="foo" />) will provide the
uploaded file name.

If you are using email or email_html parts then the <r:mailer:get name="" /> tag can be
used to retrieve the name of the uploaded file. If no file was uploaded "" will be
returned.

If you wish to show show that activity is taking place during submission you may use
the <r:mailer:submit_placeholder /> tag in your form. This will insert a hidden div with
the contents of the submit_placeholder page part. The div will be displayed when the
user clicks any submit button.

Todo:
 * Abstract tag naming, doesn't need to mimick HTML input types
 * Validate recipient emails addresses -- at least the format
 * Better Error handling
 * Status indicator during file uploads
 * Check _all_ file attachment sizes before displaying any file size errors rather
   than stopping at the first.
